+ Project summary: For this project, we were given the task of implementing a collaborative filtering algorithm. Our group was assgined Probabilistic Matrix Factorization for our algorithm and used both kernal ridge regression and knn for post-processing, comparing the results. All models were implemented in R. 

We found....(final RMSE info here)
	
**Contribution statement**: Everyone attended team meetings, smaller group meetings, and drafted code for their particular parts.

+ Xinwen Miao: Collaborated with Xiyao Yan on implementing and evaluating the kernel ridge regression post-processing method.
+ Kexin(Colleen) Su: Implemented and evaluated the k nearest neighbors post-processing method. Used this model for cross-validation and final evaluation. Also wrote the markdown part for knn.
+ Xiyao Yan: Collaborated with Xinwen Miao on implementing and evaluating the kernel ridge regression post-processing method.
+ Ruo zhou Zhang: Completed Probabilistic Matrix Factorization implementation with paramter tuning and cross validation. 
+ Jasmin Flack: Collaborated with Colleen Su on implementing and evaluating the k nearest neighbors post-processing method.
